# Quader Agent Memory

This file records hard-resolved tasks whose context is easy to lose and costly to rediscover.
Read it after `AGENTS.md` for non-trivial work, but treat current code, tests, AGENTS guidance, and
the user's request as authoritative.

When adding an entry, keep it concise and useful: date, task/context, root cause or invariant,
affected owners/files, resolved approach, and verification. Do not record routine edits, secrets,
private user data, guesses, or unresolved issues. Prefer updating a related existing entry over
adding a duplicate.

## 2026-06-27 - Source-Wire Overlays, Flipped Mesh Picking, And Inverted Face Fill

Task/context: source-wire and selection overlays had a long-running set of regressions: large wire
gaps, fading or missing edges at distance/angles, hidden internal source-wire edges on inverted
meshes, hover/deselect colors failing for inverted internal edges, occluded internal handles being
pickable from outside, and face-fill hover/selection not appearing on inverted faces.

Root cause/invariants:

- Source-wire topology is editor interaction geometry and should render as crisp draw-on-top lines.
  `SourceWireDepthStamp` is metadata only and must not render or delete source-wire line topology.
- Picking and rendering are separate concerns. Render extraction should not CPU-filter source-wire
  edges to solve pickability; source-wire interaction is accepted or rejected by picking/hover
  occlusion policy.
- Editor picking needs nearest visible two-sided surface behavior for flipped/backfacing meshes:
  backfaces are pickable, but authored front-facing faces must not beat nearer visible backfaces.
- Selected/hover face-fill overlays need two-sided triangle render state so inverted faces show fill;
  duplicating reversed geometry is not the owner fix.

Affected owners/files:

- `src/editor/modeling/runtime/session_picking.cpp`
- `src/mesh/polygon/document.h`
- `src/mesh/polygon/quader_poly_document_picking_overlay.cpp`
- `src/editor/projection/PickingCacheProjection.cpp`
- `src/editor/modeling/runtime/session_selection_overlay.cpp`
- `src/render/ViewportOverlayPolicy.cpp`
- `src/render/overlay/OverlayRenderableBuilder.cpp`
- `src/render/overlay/OverlayRenderableBuilder.h`
- `src/render/overlay/OverlayFaceFillBuilder.cpp`
- `tests/modeling_domain/qdr_modeling_runtime_picking_tests.cpp`
- `tests/modeling_domain/qdr_poly_geometry_characterization_tests.cpp`
- `tests/render_extraction_tests.cpp`
- `tests/core_tests.cpp`

Resolved approach:

- Kept `SourceWire` draw-on-top and kept `SourceWireDepthStamp` non-rendered.
- Added `PickOptions::prefer_front_facing_faces`, preserving the old low-level default while opting
  editor picking into nearest-surface behavior.
- Included the new pick option in face-geometry cache signatures.
- Routed editor hover/pick paths through one shared editor surface pick policy.
- Added modeling-domain tests for outside-vs-inside picking on flipped geometry and source-wire
  occlusion.
- Made selected and hover face-fill overlay layers two-sided in `ViewportOverlayPolicy`, preserving
  the existing depth-stamped two-pass fill pipeline.
- Added render extraction and policy tests asserting selected/hover face fills use no triangle
  culling and two-sided transparency.

Verification:

- `cmake --build --preset vs2026-debug --target quader_tests`
- `ctest --preset vs2026-debug --output-on-failure`
- `cmake --build --preset vs2026-debug --target quader`
